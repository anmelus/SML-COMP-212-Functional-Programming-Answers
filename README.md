## COMP 212: FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

Completed this class independently to learn how to do functional programming. This class is completed entirely throurgh Standard ML of New Jersey which is a slight derivative of SML. After using this language for quite some time, I can tell you that it will definately help you learn functional programming; however, Haskell is a much more modern and user-friendly choice.

Has almost all coding problems answered, sometimes there would be one very hard one ("hard" relative to my skill/understanding of SML at that moment in time) that I just did not finish. 

Skipped anything asking to compute/prove the time complexity or recurrence of as I already have experience with proofs and timings in previous classes.

On very small occasions I had to look online at someone else's code to completely understand what issue I was having which has resulted in a few changes in coding style towards the end of some assignments.
