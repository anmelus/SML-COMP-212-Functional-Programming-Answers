Completed this class independently to learn how to do functional programming. 
Has almost all coding problems answered, sometimes there would be one very hard one that I just did not finish. 
Skipped anything asking to compute/prove the time complexity of as I already have experience proving time complexity of most of the algorithms shown. 
On very small occasions I had to look online at someone else's code to completely understand what issue I was having which has resulted in a few changes in coding styles towards the end of some assignments.
